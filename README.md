# SecureJournal
A Python library intended for encrypting a journal

To get started, clone. There are a couple of dependencies

Obviously, `python` is one of those. As is `pip`.

1) https://www.python.org/downloads/

2) https://pypi.org/project/pip/#description

And then, using pip:

3) `pip install cryptography`

4) `pip install pygobject`

That _should_ do it. 
To get started, run:
`touch mySecureJournal`

`python script.py mySecureJournal` 

Then, type away using your favourite text editor!

Once you are done:

`python script.py mySecureJournal`

Happy journalling! :-)
