# SecureJournal
A Python library intended for encrypting a journal

To get started, clone. There are a couple of dependencies

Obviously, `python` is one of those. As is `pip`.

1) https://www.python.org/downloads/

2) https://pypi.org/project/pip/#description

And then, using pip:

3) `pip install cryptography`

4) `pip install pygobject`

That _should_ do it. 
To get started, open up mySecureJournal in your favourite text editor, and type away!

Once you are done:

`python script.py mySecureJournal`

Then follow the prompts. Your journal will be safely encrypted.

When you are ready to journal again, run:

`python script.py mySecureJournal`

And the script figures out the rest.

Happy journalling! :-)
